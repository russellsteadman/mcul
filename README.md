# MCUL

MCUL is a molecular parsing engine that takes text such as `CH4` or `methane` and is able to provide information such as the average atomic mass or hydrogen count.

## Installation

MCUL can be used in Node.js or with webpack, browserify, etc. Add using NPM or Yarn.
```sh
npm i -S mcul
yarn add mcul
```

MCUL can also be used over CDN.
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mcul@0.1.0-alpha1/dist/mcul.js"></script>
```

## Documentation

MCUL is currently in alpha development, and thus does not have documentation.
